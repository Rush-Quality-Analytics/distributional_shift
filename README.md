## Purpose

The concentration of a discrete or continuous distribution of frequencies or probabilities toward a lower bound is a conceptually simple property that has historically lacked a global descriptive statistic. We recently termed this property ‘shift’ and defined it as the distance of a central tendency from an upper bound, expressed as a proportion of a finite range.
