# distributional_shift
Data and Python source code for replicating analyses of "Measurement and comparison of distributional shift with applications to ecology, economics, and image analysis"

## Purpose

The concentration of a discrete or continuous distribution of frequencies or probabilities toward a lower bound is a conceptually simple property that historically lacks a global descriptive statistic. We recently termed this property ‘shift’ and defined it as the distance of a central tendency from an upper bound, expressed as a proportion of a finite range. The source code of this repository pertains to our [recent study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11119) of the shift statistics that we develop.
